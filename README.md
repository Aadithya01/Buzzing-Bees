# Buzzing Bees

Analyzed data on bee population from various sources to study the reasons behind bees dying

# Motivation
We have all heard the buzz on the newsâ€¦ bees are dying everyone says. We wanted to investigate more into this and support or reject this claim based on analysis of data.
If this is infact true, we then wanted to understand driving factors for it and if it is in our control, we wanted to create awareness in the class regarding this.

# Data
We collected data from various sources including USDA, Bee informed, NOAA, USGS.

# Approach
1) Extracted data by scraping the above sources and tranformed the data into a consolidated format to be used
2) Explored the data and developed visualizations
3) Stated our intial hypothesis and collected data further to check our hypothesis
4) Performed linear regressions to to understand the effect of the predictor on the death of bees
5) Further, studied the effect of this on honey production and prices
6) Studied effect on agricultural production

# Result
Myth : 

1)Bee loss is unsustainable, and bees are endangered

2)Bee loss is having a huge impact on agriculture production

3)Rising temperatures are leading to bee loss

4)Neonic pesticides are causing the bees to die

Truth:

1)Bee loss increased, but bee population hit a 22-year high

2)Bee loss is increasing the cost of production in agriculture 

3)No established studies/ data supporting the relation
